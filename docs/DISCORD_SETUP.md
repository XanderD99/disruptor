## Server Requirements

Your Discord server needs these features for Disruptor to work:

### Soundboard Setup
1. **Upload Sounds**
   - Go to Server Settings ‚Üí Soundboard
   - Upload .mp3 or .ogg audio files (max 5.2MB each)
   - Name your sounds appropriately

2. **Sound Requirements**
   - At least 1 soundboard sound is required
   - Sounds should be short (1-10 seconds recommended)
   - Keep volume levels consistent

### Voice Channels
- At least 1 voice channel must exist
- Bot must have permissions in voice channels
- Voice channels should be accessible to bot

---

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Basic Connection Test
```bash
# Set your bot token
export CONFIG_TOKEN="your_bot_token_here"

# Test basic connection (will fail but show connection attempt)
./output/bin/disruptor
```

**Expected Result**: Bot should connect to Discord and show online status

### 2. Verify Bot Permissions
- Check that bot appears online in your server
- Try using a slash command like `/play` (should appear in autocomplete)
- Verify bot can see voice channels

### 3. Test Soundboard Access
The bot will automatically discover soundboard sounds. Check logs for:
```
INF soundboard sounds discovered count=X guild_id=YOUR_GUILD_ID
```

---

## Common Issues

### Bot Won't Connect
- ‚úÖ Check token is correct and copied fully
- ‚úÖ Verify token hasn't been regenerated  
- ‚úÖ Check internet connection

### Missing Slash Commands
- ‚úÖ Ensure `applications.commands` scope was granted
- ‚úÖ Wait up to 1 hour for global commands to sync
- ‚úÖ Try kicking and re-inviting the bot

### Can't Join Voice Channels
- ‚úÖ Verify "Connect" and "Speak" permissions
- ‚úÖ Check voice channel user limits
- ‚úÖ Ensure bot has access to the voice channel

### No Soundboard Sounds
- ‚úÖ Upload at least one sound to server soundboard
- ‚úÖ Verify sounds are not too large (5.2MB limit)
- ‚úÖ Check bot has "Use Sounds from Other Servers" permission
